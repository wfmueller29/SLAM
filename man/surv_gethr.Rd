\title{Get Hazard Ratio from Cox Model}
\usage{
surv_gethr(fit, vars, names = NULL, ndec = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{coxph model}

\item{vars}{character vector including the covariates fo the cox model that
we would like to extract hazard ratios for. Note: if a covariate was
wrapped, for example tt(age_wk), the wrapping and the variable should be
included}

\item{names}{character vector of same length as vars that provides
formal names for the variables in place of variable name.}

\item{ndec}{numeric that specifies the number of decimal places to round
the hazard ratios}
}
\value{
\item{hr_table}{
 a dataframe whos rows correspond the variables inputted by the vars
 argument and whos names are  determined by the names argument. If the names
 argument is not given the names are the same  as the variable names.
 This dataframe has the following columns (1) value - provides the hazard
 ratio
 (2) lower - lower bound of 95% confidence interval for hazard ratio
 (3) upper - upper bound of 95% confidence interval for hazard ratio
 (4) pval - the p-value for the hazard ratio
 (5) final - a character stirng that includes columns 1-4 for table output
 (6) with_names - character string like final, but the variable name is
 included
 }
 \item{hr_text}{
 a character string that has the with names for each variable separated by
 \\n, so that the hazard ratios for vars can be included in a kaplan meier
 plot.
 }
}
\description{
The purpose of this function is so that the user can easily extract hazard
ratios, hazard ratio confidence intervals, and hazard ratio pvalues easily.
This function also outputs Hazard Ratios that can easily be added plots
